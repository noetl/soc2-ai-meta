# Claude Code Entry Point

Read these files at session start (in order):

1. `AGENTS.md` — mandatory rules for this repo
2. `agents/rules/execution-model.md` — architecture and boundary guardrails
3. `memory/current.md` — active working state
4. Latest entries in `memory/inbox/` — recent uncompacted work
5. Open tracked work items, if your project uses them
6. `sync/issues/` — in-flight coordination notes, if your project uses them
7. `handoffs/active/` — in-flight handoff rounds, if your project uses them
8. Linked wiki/doc surfaces for impacted areas, if your project uses them

## Skills (slash commands)

- `/memory-add "<title>" "<summary>" "<tags>"` — create and commit a memory entry
- `/memory-compact` — compact inbox entries into a summary
- `/sync-note "<topic>"` — create a sync note from the template
- `/bump-pointer "<repo>"` — update a linked-repo pointer after upstream merge
- `/handoff-open "<slug> \"<description>\""` — create a handoff prompt scaffold
- `/handoff-result "<slug>"` — scaffold the matching handoff result file
- `/issue-open "\"<title>\" <repo>"` — open tracked long-running issue
- `/issue-close "<number>"` — close tracked issue with landing citations

## Daily operating checks

At the start of work:

- Verify local memory and open tasks are aligned when those systems are in use.
- Verify impacted wiki/confluence pages are identified when those systems are in use.

Before pointer bumps:

- Confirm merged PR range.
- Confirm tracked issue/ticket updates.
- Confirm wiki/confluence updates for changed public surfaces when those systems are in use.

## Quick commands (manual)

- Add memory: `./scripts/memory_add.sh "<title>" "<summary>" "<tags>"`
- Compact memory: `./scripts/memory_compact.sh`
- Submodule status: `git submodule status --recursive`
- Bump pointer: `git submodule update --remote repos/<name> && git add repos/<name>`
