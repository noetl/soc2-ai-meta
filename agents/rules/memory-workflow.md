# Memory Workflow Rules

## Adding entries

- Use `./scripts/memory_add.sh "<title>" "<summary>" "<tags>"` to create entries.
- One topic per entry.
- Keep entries factual and actionable.
- Commit with `memory(add): <topic>`.

## Compaction

- Run `./scripts/memory_compact.sh` periodically (daily/weekly, or after significant work).
- Commit with `memory(compact): <scope>`.
- Only one compaction at a time (no concurrent compactors).

## Curation

- Periodically review and update `memory/current.md` to keep it focused.
- Commit with `memory(curate): <scope>`.

## Rules

- Never delete or overwrite inbox entries — append only.
- Never store secrets, tokens, or credentials in memory entries.
- Use the `## Related` section to cross-reference sync notes and other entries.
- Keep this meta-repo memory focused on cross-repo coordination and platform-level decisions.
- Store project-specific implementation memory inside the owning submodule when possible.
