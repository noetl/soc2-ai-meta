# {{PROJECT_NAME}} AI Project Template

Reusable starter repository for AI-assisted projects.

This template provides durable project memory in Git, shared agent instructions, and optional coordination patterns for multi-agent or multi-repo workflows.

It also includes a file-based handoff protocol for teams that want durable handoff threads between coding agents without losing context.

## Bootstrap a New Project Repo

Use this template, then run the included initializer once to replace all placeholders and set up the local workspace.

```bash
# 1) Clone your new meta repository created from this template
git clone {{REPO_PREFIX}}/{{PROJECT_SLUG}}-meta.git
cd {{PROJECT_SLUG}}-meta

# 2) Run initializer (interactive)
bash ./init.sh
```

What `init.sh` does:

- Replaces `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{PROJECT_SLUG}}`, `{{ORG_NAME}}`, and `{{REPO_PREFIX}}` across text files.
- Creates `.claude/rules` and `.claude/skills` symlinks to `agents/`.
- Marks memory scripts executable.
- Initializes git (if needed), creates an initial commit, and optionally sets `origin`.
- Removes `init.sh` after successful setup.

If your project uses linked repositories, initialize them after setup with the commands your workflow requires.

## What This Repo Contains

- **`repos/`** — optional linked repositories or subprojects
- **`memory/`** — Git-tracked long memory (inbox → compaction → current state)
- **`sync/`** — change notes that capture links, SHAs, and follow-ups
- **`agents/`** — shared AI agent rules, skills, and profiles
- **`playbooks/`** — repeatable checklists for common tasks
- **`handoffs/`** — durable cross-agent prompt/result threads
- **`scripts/`** — automation helpers (memory_add.sh, memory_compact.sh)

## Memory Layers

This template uses layered memory, where Git remains the durable source of truth for agent operations:

1. **Local repository memory (required)**
	- `memory/current.md`, `memory/inbox/`, `memory/compactions/`, `memory/timeline.md`
2. **Work-item memory (recommended)**
	- GitHub Issues, Jira, or another tracker for durable task state, blockers, and acceptance criteria
3. **Knowledge memory (recommended)**
	- GitHub Wiki, Confluence, or another docs system for durable architecture, runbooks, and policy pages
4. **Coordination memory (recommended)**
	- `sync/` notes that link PRs, SHAs, and external tracker/docs IDs

See `agents/rules/external-memory-systems.md` for extension patterns.

## Day-to-Day Workflow

1. **Work in the project source** — keep product code out of the template repo unless you intentionally fork it into a working project
2. **Open PRs where your source lives** — whether that is this repo, a monorepo, or linked repositories
3. **Record coordination changes** — capture what changed across repos or project areas
4. **Add memory entries** — record decisions and outcomes
5. **Compact periodically** — keep active memory small
6. **Keep external memory in sync** — update linked issues/tickets/wiki pages when state changes

## Cross-Agent Handoff Workflow

1. Open a thread in `handoffs/active/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>/`
2. Dispatcher writes `round-NN-prompt.md`
3. Executor writes `round-NN-result.md`
4. Continue with additional rounds as needed
5. Move completed thread to `handoffs/archive/`

See `handoffs/README.md` and `agents/rules/handoffs.md` if you use handoffs.

## Memory Commands

```bash
# Add a memory entry
./scripts/memory_add.sh "title" "summary" "tags"

# Compact inbox entries
./scripts/memory_compact.sh
```

## Commit Conventions

- `memory(add): <topic>` — new memory entry
- `memory(compact): <scope>` — compaction run
- `memory(curate): <scope>` — manual current.md refresh
- `chore(sync): bump <repo> to <sha>` — linked-repo pointer update
- `docs(agents): <description>` — agent infrastructure changes

## Extended Memory Storage (Jira, GitHub, Confluence)

This template supports using external systems as memory extensions when you need them:

- **GitHub Issues**: durable task lifecycle, acceptance criteria, blocker tracking
- **Jira**: program-level planning, sprint ownership, status and dependencies
- **GitHub Wiki**: engineering reference tied closely to repository surfaces
- **Confluence**: higher-level architecture and operational documentation

Recommended linking pattern for every substantive cross-repo task:

- One issue/ticket ID (`GH-123` or `PROJ-123`)
- One or more PR links
- One memory entry in `memory/inbox/`
- One sync note in `sync/issues/`
- Zero or more wiki/confluence pages

## Linking Repositories

```bash
git submodule add {{REPO_PREFIX}}/<repo-name>.git repos/<repo-name>
git commit -m "chore(sync): add <repo-name> submodule"
```

If you do not use linked repositories, replace this step with the repo-linking or dependency setup your project requires.

## AI Agent Support

This repo supports multiple AI coding agents out of the box:

| Agent | Entry Point | Auto-loads |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Rules, skills, settings, hooks |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Instructions |
| Cursor | `.cursorrules` | Instructions |
| Gemini | `GEMINI.md` (optional) | Profile + rules |
| Any other | `AGENTS.md` | Read manually |
